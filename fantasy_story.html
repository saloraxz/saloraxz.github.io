        <div id="text">The title is a song. That is because there is a song in this story. The creator of Moonlight Sonata (Ludwig Van Beethoven) lived in Vienna and Bonn, but the story isn't there. Instead, it's in a remote town on the volcanic island of Tristan Da Cunha. It is populated by sad people, just like the song's mood. One lonely night, a well-known person went for a holiday in the town. The next day, they couldn't find him. Everyone blamed the townspeople. But they fought back. Two years later, there was a war. The island had no chance. They made a deal that if they brought back the famous person within two years. The island would be spared.

        <div id="text">One month later, they started looking for him. At the darkest point of the night, there was an unusual song, a song never heard by humans. People that were asleep were drawn out of their houses. They were never seen again. The people found themselves in a strange place. There they saw the famous person. He explained that he was The Morkhani, a well-known singer. He had made friends with fantastical creatures. He told them to organize an experience they would never forget.

        <div id="text">An hour later, they were prepared for a so-called adventure. The gathering of people packed everything they needed for a long journey, even though it was just a short one. They headed to their destination, called Mount Morkhani.</div>
        <div id="text">"Why is it called Mount Morkhani?" Asked an individual.</div>
        <div id="text">Morkhani replied, "because I found it."</div>
        <div id="text">"How did you find it?" Asked someone.</div>
        <div id="text">"Was it dangerous?" Added another.</div>
        <div id="text">"I found it with the help of these creatures," replied Morkhani.</div>
        <div id="text">And so they went off into the wilderness to go to Mount Morkhani.</div>
