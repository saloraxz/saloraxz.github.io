        <h3 id="text">The title is a song. That is because there is a song in this story. The creator of Moonlight Sonata (Ludwig Van Beethoven) lived in Vienna and Bonn, but the story isn't there. Instead, it's in a remote town on the volcanic island of Tristan Da Cunha. It is populated by sad people, just like the song's mood. One lonely night, a well-known person went for a holiday in the town. The next day, they couldn't find him. Everyone blamed the townspeople. But they fought back. Two years later, there was a war. The island had no chance. They made a deal that if they brought back the famous person within two years. The island would be spared.

        <h3 id="text">One month later, they started looking for him. At the darkest point of the night, there was an unusual song, a song never heard by humans. People that were asleep were drawn out of their houses. They were never seen again. The people found themselves in a strange place. There they saw the famous person. He explained that he was The Morkhani, a well-known singer. He had made friends with fantastical creatures. He told them to organize an experience they would never forget.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <h3 id="text">An hour later, they were prepared for a so-called adventure. The gathering of people packed everything they needed for a long journey, even though it was just a short one. They headed to their destination, called Mount Morkhani.</h3>
        <h3 id="text">"Why is it called Mount Morkhani?" Asked an individual.</h3>
        <h3 id="text">Morkhani replied, "because I found it."</h3>
        <h3 id="text">"How did you find it?" Asked someone.</h3>
        <h3 id="text">"Was it dangerous?" Added another.</h3>
        <h3 id="text">"I found it with the help of these creatures," replied Morkhani.</h3>
        <h3 id="text">And so they went off into the wilderness to go to Mount Morkhani.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3 id="text">Now that I've gotten that off my list, we need to see what's happening back home. The townspeople were in panic. People started fighting each other. Someone had to step up before it was too late. Then Manimala, Morkhani's son himself, stepped up. He made an announcement.</h3>
        <h3 id="text">"I know everyone's worried about the vanishing people. I'm worried about my father as well. But it's not normal to go crazy like this. Help me clear this up. We will go find them. Who's with me!" announced Manimala.</h3>
        <h3 id="text">Everyone was astonished at what was happening. The townspeople decided to follow Manimala.
