###### The light of a candle by Yosa Buson
The light of a candle

is transferred to another candle

spring twilight.

###### The taste of rain by Jack Kerouac
The taste

of rain

– Why kneel?

***

The bottom of my shoes

are clean

from walking in the rain.

***

Snap your finger

stop the world –

rain falls harder.

***

After the shower

among the drenched roses

the bird thrashing in the bath.

***

Early morning gentle rain,

two big bumblebees

Humming at their work

***

Birds singing

in the dark

—Rainy dawn.

***

The rain has filled

the birdbath

Again, almost

***

Useless, useless,

the heavy rain

Driving into the sea.

***

The little worm

lowers itself from the roof

By a self shat thread

***

Nightfall,

boy smashing dandelions

with a stick.

***

frozen

in the birdbath

A leaf

***

In my medicine cabinet

the winter fly

has died of old age

***

Missing a kick

at the icebox door

It closed anyway.
